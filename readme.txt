This is a course project from the Database course I have taken at Tsinghua University during my undergraduate years.

In the project, I designed a database system, which can be used to manage a basketball league (or other sports events). For the fore-end, I used PyUI to design interactive surfaces where users can select options and input data. For the back-end, I used pymysql (which is a SQL library developed by Python) to update and fetch data from database. I also used a controlling system to coordinate both the fore-end and the back-end.

Since I took the course in China, the documents are mainly in Chinese, about which I feel really sorry for the inconvenience. But the pictures and codes are understandable.
